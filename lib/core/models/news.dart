        'Chinese EV company Xpeng sees shares pop 6% after it launches mass-market car',
    content:
        'BEIJING — Xpeng shares rose after the Chinese electric car company launched its new mass-market Mona brand on Tuesday with prices starting as low as \$16,812, far below that of Tesla’s Model 3.\n\nThe Chinese automaker said orders for the Mona M03 electric coupe exceeded 10,000 just 52 minutes after the car’s formal launch in Beijing.\n\nXpeng’s U.S.-listed shares closed up 6.5% in New York trading on Tuesday, while its Hong Kong-traded shares rose nearly 2% early Wednesday morning.\n\n“With cars priced under \$20,000, China is further cementing its new position as the world center for automotive manufacturing,” Michael Dunne, founder and CEO of consulting firm Dunne Insights, said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Squawk Box Asia.”\n\n“China can produce cars more cheaply than anyone else in the world,” he said.\n\nXpeng shares extended gains from Monday after a filing showed the company’s founder and CEO, He Xiaopeng, bought at least 1 million shares each of the company’s stock traded in the U.S. and Hong Kong.\n\nThe total U.S. purchase was worth nearly \$10 million, according to the filing, giving He about 18.8% of the company’s total issued share capital.\n\nXpeng shares have lost more than 45% so far this year.\n\nTesla shares closed nearly 2% lower on Tuesday. Shares of Chinese electric car companies Zeekr and Li Auto rose, while those of Nio closed mildly lower.\n\n— CNBC’s Sheila Chiang contributed to this report.\n\n',

        'Dollar General, Dollar Tree and Kroger customers pay over \$90 million a year in cash-back fees, federal agency finds',
    content:
        'Three of the nation’s largest retailers — Dollar General, Dollar Tree and Kroger — charge fees to customers who ask for “cash back” at check-out, amounting to more than \$90 million a year, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nMany retailers offer a cash-back option to consumers who pay for purchases with a debit or pre-paid card.\n\nBut levying a fee for the service may be “exploiting” certain customers, especially those who live in so-called banking deserts without easy access to a bank branch or free cash withdrawals, according to a CFPB analysis issued Tuesday.\n\nThat dynamic tends to disproportionately impact rural communities, lower earners and people of color, CFPB said.\n\nNot all retailers charge cash-back fees, which can range from \$0.50 to upwards of \$3 per transaction, according to the agency, which has cracked down on financial institutions in recent years for charging so-called “junk fees.”\n\nFive of the eight companies that the CFPB sampled offer cash back for free.\n\nThey include Albertsons, a grocer; the drugstore chains CVS and Walgreens; and discount retailers Target and Walmart. (Kroger proposed a \$25 billion merger with Albertsons in 2022, but that deal is pending in court.)\n\n“Fees to get cash back are just one more nickel and dime that all starts to add up,” said Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America, an advocacy group.\n\n“It just makes it harder and harder to get by,” he said. “It’s thousands of little cuts at a time.”\n\nA spokesperson for Dollar General said cash back can help save customers money relative to “alternative, non-retail options” like check cashing or ATM fees.\n\n“While not a financial institution, Dollar General provides cashback options at our more than 20,000 stores across the country as a service to customers who may not have convenient access to their primary financial institution,” the spokesperson said.\n\nCustomers who opt for cash back are charged a “clearly disclosed” fee, which “helps offset the variety of costs we incur to offer this helpful service,” according to a spokesperson for Dollar Tree, which operates Family Dollar and Dollar Tree stores.\n\nA spokesperson for Kroger didn’t respond to a request for comment from CNBC.\n\nKroger, Dollar General and Dollar Tree were respectively the No. 4, 17 and 19 largest U.S. retailers by sales in 2023, according to the National Retail Federation, a trade group.\n\nThe practice of charging for cash back is relatively new, Rust explained.\n\nFor example, in 2019, Kroger Co. rolled out a \$0.50 fee on cash back of \$100 or less and \$3.50 for amounts between \$100 and \$300, according to CFPB.\n\nThis applied across brands like Kroger, Fred Meyers, Ralph’s, QFC and Pick ’N Save, among others.\n\nHowever, Kroger Co. began charging for cash back at its Harris Teeter brand in January 2024: \$0.75 for amounts of \$100 or less and \$3 for larger amounts up to \$200, CFPB said.\n\nCash withdrawals from retail locations is the second most popular way to access cash, representing 17% of transactions over 2017-22, according to a CFPB analysis of the Diary and Survey of Consumer Payment Choice.\n\nATMs were the most popular, at 61%.\n\nBut there are some key differences between retail and ATM withdrawals, according to CFPB and consumer advocates.\n\nFor instance, relatively low caps on cash-back amounts make it challenging to limit the impact of fees by spreading them over larger withdrawals, they said.\n\nThe average retail cash withdrawal was \$34 from 2017-22, while it was \$126 at ATMs, CFPB said.',

        'Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway hits \$1 trillion market value, first U.S. company outside of tech to do so',
    content:
        'Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reached a \$1 trillion market capitalization on Wednesday, the first nontechnology company in the U.S. to score the coveted milestone.\n\nShares of the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate have rallied more than 28% in 2024, far above the S&P 500′s 18% gain. The \$1 trillion threshold was crossed just two days before the “Oracle of Omaha” turns 94 years old.\n\nThe shares were up 0.8% to \$696,502.02 on Wednesday, allowing it to top the \$1 trillion mark, per FactSet.\n\nThe milestone “is a testament to the firm’s financial strength and franchise value,” said Cathy Seifert, Berkshire analyst at CFRA Research. “This is significant at a time when Berkshire represents one of the few remaining conglomerates in existence today.”\n\nUnlike the six other companies in the trillion-dollar club (Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta), Berkshire is known for its old-economy focus as the owner of BNSF Railway, Geico Insurance and Dairy Queen. (Although its sizable Apple position has helped drive recent gains.)\n\nBuffett, chairman and CEO, took control of Berkshire, a struggling textile business, in the 1960s and transformed the company into a sprawling empire that encompasses insurance, railroad, retail, manufacturing and energy with an unmatched balance sheet and cash fortress.\n\n“It’s a tribute to Mr. Buffet and his management team, as ‘old economy’ businesses ... are what built Berkshire. Yet, these businesses trade at relatively much lower valuations, versus tech companies which are not a major part of Berkshire’s business mix,” said Andrew Kligerman, TD Cowen’s Berkshire analyst. “Moreover, Berkshire has achieved this through a conglomerate structure, a model that many view as ‘archaic,’ as corporations have increasingly moved to specialization over the decades.”Greg Abel, vice chairman of Berkshire’s non-insurance operations, has been named Buffett’s successor. At this year’s annual meeting, Buffett told shareholders that Abel, 62, will have the final say on Berkshire’s investing decisions when he’s no longer at the helm.\n\n',
